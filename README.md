Tasks
0. Fork me if you can!
mandatory
In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

“Who did this code?”
“How it works?”
“Where are unittests?”
“Where is this?”
“Why did they do that like this?”
“I don’t understand anything.”
“… I will refactor everything…”
But the worst thing you could possibly do is to redo everything. Please don’t do that! Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!

For this project you will fork this codebase:

update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v2
update the README.md with your information but don’t delete the initial authors
If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named AirBnB_clone_v2 with the same content of AirBnB_clone

1. Bug free!
mandatory
Do you remember the unittest module?

This codebase contains many test cases. Some are missing, but the ones included cover the basic functionality of the program.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 
All your unittests must pass without any errors at anytime in this project, with each storage engine!. Same for PEP8!

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 
Some tests won’t be relevant for some type of storage, please skip them by using the skipIf feature of the Unittest module - 26.3.6. Skipping tests and expected failures. Of course, the number of tests must be higher than the current number of tests, so if you decide to skip a test, you should write a new test!

How to test with MySQL?
First, you create a specific database for it (next tasks). After, you have to remember what the purpose of an unittest?

“Assert a current state (objects/data/database), do an action, and validate this action changed (or not) the state of your objects/data/database”

For example, “you want to validate that the create State name="California" command in the console will add a new record in your table states in your database”, here steps for your unittest:

get the number of current records in the table states (my using a MySQLdb for example - but not SQLAlchemy (remember, you want to test if it works, so it’s better to isolate from the system))
execute the console command
get (again) the number of current records in the table states (same method, with MySQLdb)
if the difference is +1 => test passed

2. Console improvements
mandatory
Update the def do_create(self, arg): function of your command interpreter (console.py) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

Command syntax: create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...
Param syntax: <key name>=<value>
Value syntax:
String: "<value>" => starts with a double quote
any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash \
all underscores _ must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string My little house to the attribute name, your command line must be name="My_little_house"
Float: <unit>.<decimal> => contains a dot .
Integer: <number> => default case
If any parameter doesn’t fit with these requirements or can’t be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped
Don’t forget to add tests for this new feature!

Also, this new feature will be tested here only with FileStorage engine.

3. MySQL setup development
mandatory
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_dev_db
A new user hbnb_dev (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_dev_db or the user hbnb_dev already exists, your script should not fail

4. MySQL setup test
mandatory
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_test_db
A new user hbnb_test (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_test should be set to hbnb_test_pwd
hbnb_test should have all privileges on the database hbnb_test_db (and only this database)
hbnb_test should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_test_db or the user hbnb_test already exists, your script should not fail

5. Delete object
mandatory
Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a new public instance method: def delete(self, obj=None): to delete obj from __objects if it’s inside - if obj is equal to None, the method should not do anything
Update the prototype of def all(self) to def all(self, cls=None) - that returns the list of objects of one type of class. Example below with State - it’s an optional filtering

6. DBStorage - States and Cities
mandatory
SQLAlchemy will be your best friend!

It’s time to change your storage engine and use SQLAlchemy



In the following steps, you will make multiple changes:

the biggest one is the transition between FileStorage and DBStorage: In the industry, you will never find a system who can work with both in the same time - but you will find a lot of services who can manage multiple storage systems. (for example, logs service: in memory, in disk, in database, in ElasticSearch etc…) - The main concept behind is the abstraction: Make your code running without knowing how it’s stored.
add attributes for SQLAlchemy: they will be class attributes, like previously, with a “weird” value. Don’t worry, these values are for description and mapping to the database. If you change one of these values, or add/remove one attribute of the a model, you will have to delete the database and recreate it in SQL. (Yes it’s not optimal, but for development purposes, it’s ok. In production, we will add “migration mechanism” - for the moment, don’t spend time on it.)
Please follow all these steps:

Update BaseModel: (models/base_model.py)

Create Base = declarative_base() before the class definition of BaseModel
Note! BaseModel does /not/ inherit from Base. All other classes will inherit from BaseModel to get common values (id, created_at, updated_at), where inheriting from Base will actually cause SQLAlchemy to attempt to map it to a table.
Add or replace in the class BaseModel:
class attribute id
represents a column containing a unique string (60 characters)
can’t be null
primary key
class attribute created_at
represents a column containing a datetime
can’t be null
default value is the current datetime (use datetime.utcnow())
class attribute updated_at
represents a column containing a datetime
can’t be null
default value is the current datetime (use datetime.utcnow())
Move the models.storage.new(self) from def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): to def save(self): and call it just before models.storage.save()
In def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):, manage kwargs to create instance attribute from this dictionary. Ex: kwargs={ 'name': "California" } => self.name = "California" if it’s not already the case
Update the to_dict() method of the class BaseModel:
remove the key _sa_instance_state from the dictionary returned by this method only if this key exists
Add a new public instance method: def delete(self): to delete the current instance from the storage (models.storage) by calling the method delete
Update City: (models/city.py)

City inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class City:
class attribute __tablename__ -
represents the table name, cities
class attribute name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute state_id
represents a column containing a string (60 characters)
can’t be null
is a foreign key to states.id
Update State: (models/state.py)

State inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class State:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, states
class attribute name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
for DBStorage: class attribute cities must represent a relationship with the class City. If the State object is deleted, all linked City objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a City object to his State should be named state
for FileStorage: getter attribute cities that returns the list of City instances with state_id equals to the current State.id => It will be the FileStorage relationship between State and City
New engine DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)

Private class attributes:
__engine: set to None
__session: set to None
Public instance methods:
__init__(self):
create the engine (self.__engine)
the engine must be linked to the MySQL database and user created before (hbnb_dev and hbnb_dev_db):
dialect: mysql
driver: mysqldb
all of the following values must be retrieved via environment variables:
MySQL user: HBNB_MYSQL_USER
MySQL password: HBNB_MYSQL_PWD
MySQL host: HBNB_MYSQL_HOST (here = localhost)
MySQL database: HBNB_MYSQL_DB
don’t forget the option pool_pre_ping=True when you call create_engine
drop all tables if the environment variable HBNB_ENV is equal to test
all(self, cls=None):
query on the current database session (self.__session) all objects depending of the class name (argument cls)
if cls=None, query all types of objects (User, State, City, Amenity, Place and Review)
this method must return a dictionary: (like FileStorage)
key = <class-name>.<object-id>
value = object
new(self, obj): add the object to the current database session (self.__session)
save(self): commit all changes of the current database session (self.__session)
delete(self, obj=None): delete from the current database session obj if not None
reload(self):
create all tables in the database (feature of SQLAlchemy) (WARNING: all classes who inherit from Base must be imported before calling Base.metadata.create_all(engine))
create the current database session (self.__session) from the engine (self.__engine) by using a sessionmaker - the option expire_on_commit must be set to False ; and scoped_session - to make sure your Session is thread-safe
Update __init__.py: (models/__init__.py)

Add a conditional depending of the value of the environment variable HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE:
If equal to db:
Import DBStorage class in this file
Create an instance of DBStorage and store it in the variable storage (the line storage.reload() should be executed after this instantiation)
Else:
Import FileStorage class in this file
Create an instance of FileStorage and store it in the variable storage (the line storage.reload() should be executed after this instantiation)
This “switch” will allow you to change storage type directly by using an environment variable (example below)
State creation:

represents a column containing a string (1024 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute place_id
represents a column containing a string (60 characters)

Update Place: (models/place.py)

for DBStorage: class attribute reviews must represent a relationship with the class Review. If the Place object is deleted, all linked Review objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a Review object to his Place should be named place
for FileStorage: getter attribute reviews that returns the list of Review instances with place_id equals to the current Place.id => It will be the FileStorage relationship between Place and Review

10. DBStorage - Amenity... and BOOM!
mandatory
Update Amenity: (models/amenity.py)

Amenity inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)

class attribute place_amenities must represent a relationship Many-To-Many between the class Place and Amenity. Please see below more detail: place_amenity in the Place update
Update Place: (models/place.py)

Add an instance of SQLAlchemy Table called place_amenity for creating the relationship Many-To-Many between Place and Amenity:
table name place_amenity
metadata = Base.metadata
2 columns:
place_id, a string of 60 characters foreign key of places.id, primary key in the table and never null
amenity_id, a string of 60 characters foreign key of amenities.id, primary key in the table and never null
Update Place class:
for DBStorage: class attribute amenities must represent a relationship with the class Amenity but also as secondary to place_amenity with option viewonly=False (place_amenity has been define previously)
for FileStorage:
Getter attribute amenities that returns the list of Amenity instances based on the attribute amenity_ids that contains all Amenity.id linked to the Place
Setter attribute amenities that handles append method for adding an Amenity.id to the attribute amenity_ids. This method should accept only Amenity object, otherwise, do nothing.
What’s a Many-to-Many relationship?
In our system, we don’t want to duplicate amenities (for example, having 10000 time the amenity Wifi), so they will be unique. But, at least 2 places can have the same amenity (like Wifi for example). We are in the case of:

an amenity can be linked to multiple places
a place can have multiple amenities
= Many-To-Many

To make this link working, we will create a third table called place_amenity that will create these links.

And you are good, you have a new engine!

<center> <h1>HBNB - The Console</h1> </center>

This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

<center> <h2>General Use</h2> </center>

1. First clone this repository.

3. Once the repository is cloned locate the "console.py" file and run it as follows:
```
/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
```
4. When this command is run the following prompt should appear:
```
(hbnb)
```
5. This prompt designates you are in the "HBnB" console. There are a variety of commands available within the console program.

##### Commands
    * create - Creates an instance based on given class

    * destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

    * quit - Exits the program (EOF will as well)


##### Alternative Syntax
Users are able to issue a number of console command using an alternative syntax:

	Usage: <class_name>.<command>([<id>[name_arg value_arg]|[kwargs]])
Advanced syntax is implemented for the following commands: 

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

	* count - Return number of object instances by class

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

	* destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

0x03. AirBnB clone - Deploy static

Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

CI/CD
AirBnB clone
Background Context
Ever since you completed project 0x0F. Load balancer of the SysAdmin track, you’ve had 2 web servers + 1 load balancer but nothing to distribute with them.

It’s time to make your work public!

In this first deployment project, you will be deploying your web_static work. You will use Fabric (for Python3). Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks. It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell commands (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading files, as well as auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or aborting execution. This concept is important: execute commands locally or remotely. Locally means in your laptop (physical laptop or inside your Vagrant), and Remotely means on your server(s). Fabric is taking care of all network connections (SSH, SCP etc.), it’s an easy tool for transferring, executing, etc. commands from locale to a remote server.

Before starting, please fork the repository AirBnB_clone_v2 from your partner if you don’t have it

You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
<<<<<<< HEAD
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
Python Unit Tests
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module
All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
All your test files and folders should start by test_
Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases
GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

Tasks
0. Restart from scratch!
mandatory
No no no! We are already too far in the project to restart everything.

But once again, let’s work on a new codebase.

For this project you will fork this codebase:

Update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v3
Update the README.md:
Add yourself as an author of the project
Add new information about your new contribution
Make it better!
If you’re the owner of this codebase, create a new repository called AirBnB_clone_v3 and copy over all files from AirBnB_clone_v2
Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v3
 
1. Never fail!
mandatory


Since the beginning we’ve been using the unittest module, but do you know why unittests are so important? Because when you add a new feature, you refactor a piece of code, etc… you want to be sure you didn’t break anything.

At Holberton, we have a lot of tests, and they all pass! Just for the Intranet itself, there are:

5,213 assertions (as of 08/20/2018)
13,061 assertions (as of 01/25/2021)
The following requirements must be met for your project:

all current tests must pass (don’t delete them…)
add new tests as much as you can (tests are mandatory for some tasks)
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 | tail -1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ 
Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v3
  
2. Improve storage
mandatory
Update DBStorage and FileStorage, adding two new methods. All changes should be done in the branch storage_get_count:

A method to retrieve one object:

Prototype: def get(self, cls, id):
cls: class
id: string representing the object ID
Returns the object based on the class and its ID, or None if not found
A method to count the number of objects in storage:

Prototype: def count(self, cls=None):
cls: class (optional)
Returns the number of objects in storage matching the given class. If no class is passed, returns the count of all objects in storage.
Don’t forget to add new tests for these 2 methods on each storage engine.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ cat test_get_count.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" Test .get() and .count() methods
"""
from models import storage
from models.state import State

print("All objects: {}".format(storage.count()))
print("State objects: {}".format(storage.count(State)))

first_state_id = list(storage.all(State).values())[0].id
print("First state: {}".format(storage.get(State, first_state_id)))

For this task, you must make a pull request on GitHub.com, and ask at least one of your peer to review and merge it.

Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v3

3. Status of your API
mandatory
It’s time to start your API!

Your first endpoint (route) will be to return the status of your API:

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db HBNB_API_HOST=0.0.0.0 HBNB_API_PORT=5000 python3 -m api.v1.app
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
...
In another terminal:

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ curl -X GET http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status
{
  "status": "OK"
}
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ curl -X GET -s http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status -vvv 2>&1 | grep Content-Type
< Content-Type: application/json
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ 
Magic right? (No need to have a pretty rendered output, it’s a JSON, only the structure is important)

Ok, let starts:

Create a folder api at the root of the project with an empty file __init__.py
Create a folder v1 inside api:
create an empty file __init__.py
create a file app.py:
create a variable app, instance of Flask
import storage from models
import app_views from api.v1.views
register the blueprint app_views to your Flask instance app
declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext that calls storage.close()
inside if __name__ == "__main__":, run your Flask server (variable app) with:
host = environment variable HBNB_API_HOST or 0.0.0.0 if not defined
port = environment variable HBNB_API_PORT or 5000 if not defined
threaded=True
Create a folder views inside v1:
create a file __init__.py:
import Blueprint from flask doc
create a variable app_views which is an instance of Blueprint (url prefix must be /api/v1)
wildcard import of everything in the package api.v1.views.index => PEP8 will complain about it, don’t worry, it’s normal and this file (v1/views/__init__.py) won’t be check.
create a file index.py
import app_views from api.v1.views
create a route /status on the object app_views that returns a JSON: "status": "OK" (see example)
Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v3
File: api/__init__.py, api/v1/__init__.py, api/v1/views/__init__.py, api/v1/views/index.py, api/v1/app.py
  
4. Some stats?
mandatory
Create an endpoint that retrieves the number of each objects by type:

In api/v1/views/index.py
Route: /api/v1/stats
You must use the newly added count() method from storage
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ curl -X GET http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/stats
{
  "amenities": 47, 
  "cities": 36, 
  "places": 154, 
  "reviews": 718, 
  "states": 27, 
  "users": 31
}
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ 
(No need to have a pretty rendered output, it’s a JSON, only the structure is important)

Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v3
File: api/v1/views/index.py
  
5. Not found
mandatory
Designers are really creative when they have to design a “404 page”, a “Not found”… 34 brilliantly designed 404 error pages

Today it’s different, because you won’t use HTML and CSS, but JSON!

In api/v1/app.py, create a handler for 404 errors that returns a JSON-formatted 404 status code response. The content should be: "error": "Not found"

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ curl -X GET http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/nop
{
  "error": "Not found"
}
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ curl -X GET http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/nop -vvv

Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v3
File: api/v1/app.py
  
6. State
mandatory
Create a new view for State objects that handles all default RESTFul API actions:

In the file api/v1/views/states.py
You must use to_dict() to retrieve an object into a valid JSON
Update api/v1/views/__init__.py to import this new file
Retrieves the list of all State objects: GET /api/v1/states

Retrieves a State object: GET /api/v1/states/<state_id>

If the state_id is not linked to any State object, raise a 404 error
Deletes a State object:: DELETE /api/v1/states/<state_id>

If the state_id is not linked to any State object, raise a 404 error
Returns an empty dictionary with the status code 200
Creates a State: POST /api/v1/states

You must use request.get_json from Flask to transform the HTTP body request to a dictionary
If the HTTP body request is not valid JSON, raise a 400 error with the message Not a JSON
If the dictionary doesn’t contain the key name, raise a 400 error with the message Missing name
Returns the new State with the status code 201
Updates a State object: PUT /api/v1/states/<state_id>

If the state_id is not linked to any State object, raise a 404 error
You must use request.get_json from Flask to transform the HTTP body request to a dictionary
If the HTTP body request is not valid JSON, raise a 400 error with the message Not a JSON
Update the State object with all key-value pairs of the dictionary.
Ignore keys: id, created_at and updated_at
Returns the State object with the status code 200

12. HTTP access control (CORS)
mandatory
A resource makes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource from a different domain, or port, than the one the first resource itself serves.

Read the full definition here

Why do we need this?

Because you will soon start allowing a web client to make requests your API. If your API doesn’t have a correct CORS setup, your web client won’t be able to access your data.

With Flask, it’s really easy, you will use the class CORS of the module flask_cors.

How to install it: $ pip3 install flask_cors

Update api/v1/app.py to create a CORS instance allowing: /* for 0.0.0.0

You will update it later when you will deploy your API to production.

Now you can see this HTTP Response Header: < Access-Control-Allow-Origin: 0.0.0.0

13. Place - Amenity
#advanced
Create a new view for the link between Place objects and Amenity objects that handles all default RESTFul API actions:

In the file api/v1/views/places_amenities.py
You must use to_dict() to retrieve an object into a valid JSON
Update api/v1/views/__init__.py to import this new file
Depending of the storage:
DBStorage: list, create and delete Amenity objects from amenities relationship
FileStorage: list, add and remove Amenity ID in the list amenity_ids of a Place object
Retrieves the list of all Amenity objects of a Place: GET /api/v1/places/<place_id>/amenities

If the place_id is not linked to any Place object, raise a 404 error
Deletes a Amenity object to a Place: DELETE /api/v1/places/<place_id>/amenities/<amenity_id>

If the place_id is not linked to any Place object, raise a 404 error
If the amenity_id is not linked to any Amenity object, raise a 404 error
If the Amenity is not linked to the Place before the request, raise a 404 error
Returns an empty dictionary with the status code 200
Link a Amenity object to a Place: POST /api/v1/places/<place_id>/amenities/<amenity_id>

No HTTP body needed
If the place_id is not linked to any Place object, raise a 404 error
If the amenity_id is not linked to any Amenity object, raise a 404 error
If the Amenity is already linked to the Place, return the Amenity with the status code 200
Returns the Amenity with the status code 201

14. Security improvements!
#advanced
Currently, the User object is designed to store the user password in cleartext.

It’s super bad!

To avoid that, improve the User object:

Update the method to_dict() of BaseModel to remove the password key except when it’s used by FileStorage to save data to disk. Tips: default parameters
Each time a new User object is created or password updated, the password is hashed to a MD5 value
In the database for DBStorage, the password stored is now hashed to a MD5 value
In the file for FileStorage, the password stored is now hashed to a MD5 value

15. Search
#advanced
For the moment, the only way to list Place objects is via GET /api/v1/cities/<city_id>/places.

Good, but not enough…

Update api/v1/views/places.py to add a new endpoint: POST /api/v1/places_search that retrieves all Place objects depending of the JSON in the body of the request.

The JSON can contain 3 optional keys:

states: list of State ids
cities: list of City ids
amenities: list of Amenity ids
Search rules:

If the HTTP request body is not valid JSON, raise a 400 error with the message Not a JSON
If the JSON body is empty or each list of all keys are empty: retrieve all Place objects
If states list is not empty, results should include all Place objects for each State id listed
If cities list is not empty, results should include all Place objects for each City id listed
Keys states and cities are inclusive. Search results should include all Place objects in storage related to each City in every State listed in states, plus every City listed individually in cities, unless that City was already included by states.
Context:
State A has 2 cities A1 and A2
State B has 3 cities B1, B2 and B3
A1 has 1 place
A2 has 2 places
B1 has 3 places
B2 has 4 places
B3 has 5 places
Search: states = State A and cities = B2
Result: all 4 places from the city B2 and the place from the city A1 and the 2 places of the city A2 (because they are part of State A) => 7 places returned
If amenities list is not empty, limit search results to only Place objects having all Amenity ids listed
The key amenities is exclusive, acting as a filter on the results generated by states and cities, or on all Place if states and cities are both empty or missing.
Results will only include Place objects having all listed amenities. If a Place doesn’t have even one of these amenities, it won’t be retrieved.

Tasks
0. Prepare your web servers
mandatory
Write a Bash script that sets up your web servers for the deployment of web_static. It must:

Install Nginx if it not already installed
Create the folder /data/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/shared/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/test/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create a fake HTML file /data/web_static/releases/test/index.html (with simple content, to test your Nginx configuration)
Create a symbolic link /data/web_static/current linked to the /data/web_static/releases/test/ folder. If the symbolic link already exists, it should be deleted and recreated every time the script is ran.
Give ownership of the /data/ folder to the ubuntu user AND group (you can assume this user and group exist). This should be recursive; everything inside should be created/owned by this user/group.
Update the Nginx configuration to serve the content of /data/web_static/current/ to hbnb_static (ex: https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static). Don’t forget to restart Nginx after updating the configuration:
Use alias inside your Nginx configuration
Tip
Your program should always exit successfully. Don’t forget to run your script on both of your web servers.

In optional, you will redo this task but by using Puppet

1. Compress before sending
mandatory
Write a Fabric script that generates a .tgz archive from the contents of the web_static folder of your AirBnB Clone repo, using the function do_pack.

Prototype: def do_pack():
All files in the folder web_static must be added to the final archive
All archives must be stored in the folder versions (your function should create this folder if it doesn’t exist)
The name of the archive created must be web_static_<year><month><day><hour><minute><second>.tgz
The function do_pack must return the archive path if the archive has been correctly generated. Otherwise, it should return None

2. Deploy archive!
mandatory
Write a Fabric script (based on the file 1-pack_web_static.py) that distributes an archive to your web servers, using the function do_deploy:

Prototype: def do_deploy(archive_path):
Returns False if the file at the path archive_path doesn’t exist
The script should take the following steps:
Upload the archive to the /tmp/ directory of the web server
Uncompress the archive to the folder /data/web_static/releases/<archive filename without extension> on the web server
Delete the archive from the web server
Delete the symbolic link /data/web_static/current from the web server
Create a new the symbolic link /data/web_static/current on the web server, linked to the new version of your code (/data/web_static/releases/<archive filename without extension>)
All remote commands must be executed on your both web servers (using env.hosts = ['<IP web-01>', 'IP web-02'] variable in your script)
Returns True if all operations have been done correctly, otherwise returns False
You must use this script to deploy it on your servers: xx-web-01 and xx-web-02
In the following example, the SSH key and the username used for accessing to the server are passed in the command line. Of course, you could define them as Fabric environment variables (ex: env.user =...)

Disclaimer: commands execute by Fabric displayed below are linked to the way we implemented the archive function do_pack - like the mv command - depending of your implementation of it, you may don’t need it

3. Full deployment
mandatory
Write a Fabric script (based on the file 2-do_deploy_web_static.py) that creates and distributes an archive to your web servers, using the function deploy:

Prototype: def deploy():

4. Keep it clean!
#advanced
Write a Fabric script (based on the file 3-deploy_web_static.py) that deletes out-of-date archives, using the function do_clean:

Prototype: def do_clean(number=0):
number is the number of the archives, including the most recent, to keep.
If number is 0 or 1, keep only the most recent version of your archive.
if number is 2, keep the most recent, and second most recent versions of your archive.
etc.
Your script should:
Delete all unnecessary archives (all archives minus the number to keep) in the versions folder
Delete all unnecessary archives (all archives minus the number to keep) in the /data/web_static/releases folder of both of your web servers
All remote commands must be executed on both of your web servers (using the env.hosts = ['<IP web-01>', 'IP web-02'] variable in your script)
In the following example, the SSH key and the username used for accessing to the server are passed in the command line. Of course, you could define them as Fabric environment variables (ex: env.user =…)
